    This is a JavaScript-based Todo application where tasks are stored in an array as state. 
    The UI is dynamically rendered using document.createElement for safe DOM manipulation.
    It supports task creation, completion toggling using CSS classes, deletion using event delegation, input validation, and real-time UI synchronization with state
