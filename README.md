I disabled browser validation and implemented custom JavaScript validation.
Each input has its own validation function using conditions and regex.
Errors are displayed below inputs dynamically for better UX.
I used reusable functions to avoid repetition and added real-time validation using keyup events.
Form submission is prevented until all fields are valid.
